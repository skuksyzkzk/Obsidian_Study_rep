`delete a` assigns the initial value for the type to `a`. I.e. for integers it is equivalent to `a = 0`, but it can also be used on arrays, where it assigns a dynamic array of length zero or a static array of the same length with all elements set to their initial value. `delete a[x]` deletes the item at index `x` of the array and leaves all other elements and the length of the array untouched. This especially means that it leaves a gap in the array. If you plan to remove items, a [mapping](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/types.html#mapping-types) is probably a better choice.
